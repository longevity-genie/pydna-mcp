MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for PyDNA - comprehensive DNA simulation and molecular cloning tools

This server implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for PyDNA, providing a standardized interface for DNA simulation and molecular cloning operations. MCP enables AI assistants and agents to perform sophisticated molecular biology tasks through structured interfaces, making computational DNA manipulation as natural as describing your experimental workflow.

The server wraps the powerful PyDNA library to offer:

- **PCR Simulation**: Design primers, simulate amplification, analyze products
- **Primer Design**: Automated primer design with customizable parameters  
- **Restriction Analysis**: Enzyme mapping, digestion simulation, fragment analysis
- **DNA Assembly**: Gibson assembly, homologous recombination, fragment joining
- **Sequence Manipulation**: Creation, analysis, reverse complement, format conversion
- **Gel Electrophoresis**: Simulate gel runs for fragment size analysis
- **GenBank Integration**: Download sequences, read/write various file formats
- **Molecular Calculations**: Melting temperatures, GC content, molecular weights

If you want to understand more about what the Model Context Protocol is and how to use it more efficiently, you can take the [DeepLearning AI Course](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/mcp-build-rich-context-ai-apps-with-anthropic/) or search for MCP videos on YouTube.

## Usage Example

Here's how PyDNA MCP server enables natural language molecular cloning:

```
User: "I want to amplify the GFP gene from pGLO plasmid using primers with EcoRI sites for cloning into pUC19"

AI Assistant: I'll help you design that cloning strategy:
1. First, let me design primers with EcoRI sites for GFP
2. Simulate the PCR amplification  
3. Analyze the restriction sites in both your PCR product and pUC19
4. Show you the expected fragments after digestion

[Uses pydna-mcp tools to execute each step]
```

*The server translates complex molecular biology workflows into simple tool calls, making computational cloning design accessible through natural language interaction with AI assistants.*

## Quick Start

### Installing uv

```bash
# Download and install uv
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Verify installation
uv --version
uvx --version
```

uvx is a very nice tool that can run a python package installing it if needed.

### Running with uvx

You can run the pydna-mcp server directly using uvx without cloning the repository:

```bash
# Run the server in STDIO mode (default)
uvx pydna-mcp
```

<details>
<summary>Other uvx modes (STDIO, HTTP, SSE)</summary>

#### STDIO Mode (for MCP clients that require stdio)

```bash
# Or explicitly specify stdio mode  
uvx pydna-mcp stdio
```

#### HTTP Mode (Web Server)
```bash
# Run the server in streamable HTTP mode on default (3001) port
uvx pydna-mcp server

# Run on a specific port
uvx pydna-mcp server --port 8000
```

#### SSE Mode (Server-Sent Events)
```bash
# Run the server in SSE mode
uvx pydna-mcp sse
```

</details>

In cases when there are problems with uvx often they can be caused by cleaning uv cache:
```
uv cache clean
```

The HTTP mode will start a web server that you can access at `http://localhost:3001/mcp` (with documentation at `http://localhost:3001/docs`). The STDIO mode is designed for MCP clients that communicate via standard input/output, while SSE mode uses Server-Sent Events for real-time communication.

## Configuring your AI Client (Anthropic Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)

### Quick Configuration Example

Here's what you can copy directly into your Claude Desktop or Cursor MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pydna-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["pydna-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "MCP_PORT": "3001",
        "MCP_HOST": "0.0.0.0", 
        "MCP_TRANSPORT": "stdio"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Alternative: Using Preconfigured Files

We also provide preconfigured JSON files for different use cases (coming soon):

- **For STDIO mode (recommended):** Use `mcp-config-stdio.json`
- **For HTTP mode:** Use `mcp-config.json`
- **For local development:** Use `mcp-config-stdio-debug.json`

### Inspecting PyDNA MCP server

<details>
<summary>Using MCP Inspector to explore server capabilities</summary>

If you want to inspect the methods provided by the MCP server, use npx (you may need to install nodejs and npm):

For STDIO mode with uvx:
```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uvx pydna-mcp
```

You can also run the inspector manually and configure it through the interface:
```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

After that you can explore the tools and resources with MCP Inspector at http://127.0.0.1:6274 (note, if you run inspector several times it can change port)

</details>

### Integration with AI Systems

Simply point your AI client (like Cursor, Windsurf, ClaudeDesktop, VS Code with Copilot, or [others](https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-clients)) to use the appropriate configuration from above.

## Repository setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/antonkulaga/pydna-mcp.git
cd pydna-mcp
uv sync
```

### Running the MCP Server

If you already cloned the repo you can run the server with uv:

```bash
# Start the MCP server locally (HTTP mode)
uv run server

# Or start in STDIO mode
uv run stdio

# Or start in SSE mode  
uv run sse
```

## Common Molecular Biology Workflows

<details>
<summary>Detailed workflow examples</summary>

### 1. Basic PCR Design & Simulation

```python
# Natural language workflow:
# "Design primers for my gene and simulate PCR"

# 1. Create your template sequence
template = "ATGGCTAGCATGACTGGTGGACAGCAAATGGGTCG..."

# 2. Design primers automatically
primers = design_primers(template, target_tm=60.0)

# 3. Simulate PCR amplification  
amplicon = pcr_amplify(primers.forward, primers.reverse, template)

# 4. Analyze the product
gel_result = gel_electrophoresis([amplicon.sequence])
```

### 2. Restriction Cloning Workflow

```python
# Natural language workflow:
# "I want to clone my PCR product into pUC19 using EcoRI and BamHI"

# 1. Analyze restriction sites in your insert
insert_analysis = restriction_analysis(pcr_product, ["EcoRI", "BamHI"])

# 2. Analyze sites in vector
vector_analysis = restriction_analysis(puc19_sequence, ["EcoRI", "BamHI"])  

# 3. Digest both sequences
digested_insert = digest_sequence(pcr_product, ["EcoRI", "BamHI"])
digested_vector = digest_sequence(puc19_sequence, ["EcoRI", "BamHI"])

# 4. Check fragment sizes on gel
gel_check = gel_electrophoresis([digested_insert.fragments, digested_vector.fragments])
```

### 3. Gibson Assembly Design

```python
# Natural language workflow:  
# "Design Gibson assembly to join three DNA fragments"

# 1. Prepare your fragments with overlaps
fragments = [fragment1, fragment2, fragment3]

# 2. Design Gibson assembly
assembly_result = gibson_assembly(fragments, overlap=20)

# 3. Verify the final construct
final_info = sequence_info(assembly_result.sequence)
```

### 4. Primer Analysis & Optimization

```python
# Natural language workflow:
# "Check if my existing primers will work with this template"

# 1. Test primer annealing
annealing_result = anneal_primers([forward_primer, reverse_primer], template)

# 2. If primers need optimization, redesign them
if annealing_result.efficiency < 0.8:
    better_primers = design_primers(template, target_tm=58.0)
```
